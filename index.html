    <div class="content">
      He can only appear after sunset and before sunrise. In other words, he can’t exist in the area where sun is in the sky. Because Sunshine would destroy his energy which comes from people’s dreams.
In addition, Mr.Dream has a sweet tooth. He is addicted to sweet dreams. This weakness made him get into a lot of troubles, and one of them is that he exposed his trace in the human world a few times.

    <div class="content">
      Mr. Dream has no concrete body. This is one of his weakness though, it could be a superpower as well. It’s easier for him to sneak into people’s house and steal their dreams with invisible and flexible body.
His main super power is that he is able to control people’s dreams. After a hundred years accumulation of energy, he obtains the access to get in and out of dreams as he wants. In the meantime, he can also decide the development of people’s dreams. For human being, the dream is a key connected to their unconsciousness. Through controlling people’s dreams, Mr,Dream indirectly controls people’s subconscious. Therefore, he plans to occupy the whole world step by step through controlling human being.
